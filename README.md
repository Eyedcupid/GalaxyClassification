## Abstract
Galaxy morphology classification plays a crucial role in understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies. Traditional methods for classifying galaxy morphology rely on human-expert knowledge and manual inspection, making them time-consuming and subjective. This study explores the application of unsupervised learning techniques for the automated classification of optical galaxy morphology.

The Zoobot library can be found here: https://github.com/mwalmsley/zoobot

The alternate versions of Zoobot used for the architecture comparison can be found [here](https://github.com/ezrafielding/zoobot-arch-comp).

## Unsupervised Learning
The code, notebooks and logs associated with the unsupervised learning section of this project can be found in the ```unsupervised_learning``` directory.
The autoencoder Python files can be found there, along with the Jupyter Notebook used for k-means clustering.

## Data Prep
The ```data_prep``` directory contains the Notebooks required for creating a working dataset.
The Galaxy DECaLS files are required for this to work. They can be found on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4573248)

## Logs and Jobs
The ```logs``` and ```jobs``` contain the log files from ilifu and Lengau and the job files for ilifu and Lengau, respectively.
